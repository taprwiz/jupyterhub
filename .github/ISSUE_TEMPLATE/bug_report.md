Hi! Thanks for using JupyterHub.

If you are reporting an issue with JupyterHub, please use the GitHub search feature to check if your issue has been asked already. If it has, please add your comments to the existing issue.

Some tips:
- Running `jupyter troubleshoot` from the command line, if possible, and posting
its output would also be helpful.
- Running JupyterHub in `--debug` mode (`jupyterhub --debug`) can also be helpful for troubleshooting.
