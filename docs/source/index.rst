JupyterHub
==========

.. note:: This is the official documentation for JupyterHub. This project is
          under active development.

JupyterHub is a multi-user server that manages and proxies multiple instances
of the single-user Jupyter notebook server.

Three actors:

* multi-user Hub (tornado process)
* `configurable http proxy <https://github.com/jupyter/configurable-http-proxy>`_ (node-http-proxy)
* multiple single-user IPython notebook servers (Python/IPython/tornado)

Basic principles:

* Hub spawns proxy
* Proxy forwards ~all requests to hub by default
* Hub handles login, and spawns single-user servers on demand
* Hub configures proxy to forward url prefixes to single-user servers
