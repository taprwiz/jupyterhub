Community communication channels
================================

There is a place for everyone in the Jupyter community to share thoughts and ask questions. We use `Discourse <https://discourse.jupyter.org>`_ , `Gitter <https://gitter.im>`_ , and GitHub issues for online discussion.

JupyterHub's main Gitter channel is `jupyterhub/jupyterhub <https://gitter.im/jupyterhub/jupyterhub>`_.
However, to ensure that discussions are the most useful and accessible to the community, we advise using Discourse first as Gitter doesn't have an archive or search function
Please be patient if you do not recieve a response right away; keep in mind that our comunity is spread out over the globe in different timezones.

Most lengthy project conversations, bug reports, and feature requests take place via GitHub issues. If you have an issue with a certain authenticator or spawner, you should report them to the relevant repository. If you are using a specific JupyterHub
distribution (such as `Zero to JupyterHub on Kubernetes <http://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s>`_
or `The Littlest JupyterHub <http://github.com/jupyterhub/the-littlest-jupyterhub/>`_),
you should open issues directly in the respective repository. If you can not
find a repository to open your issue in, do not worry! Create it in the `main
JupyterHub repository <https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/>`_ and our
community will help you figure it out.

There is a `mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jupyter>`_ for `teaching with Jupyter
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jupyter-education>`_ as well as one for the entire of Project Jupyter.
