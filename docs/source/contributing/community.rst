Community communication channels
================================

`Discourse <https://discourse.jupyter.org>`_ is primarily used by the Jupyter community for discussions and support. Additionally, we use JupyterHub's primary Gitter channel, `jupyterhub/jupyterhub <https://gitter.im/jupyterhub/jupyterhub>`_, for quick discussions, and GitHub issues for detailed discussions relating to modifying a repository's content.
If you have an issue with a certain authenticator or spawner, please report them to the relevant repository. If you are using a specific JupyterHub
distribution (such as `Zero to JupyterHub on Kubernetes <http://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s>`_
or `The Littlest JupyterHub <http://github.com/jupyterhub/the-littlest-jupyterhub/>`_),
you should open issues directly in the respective repository. If you can not
find a repository to open your issue in, do not worry! Create it in the `main
JupyterHub repository <https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/>`_ and our
community will help you figure it out.

Please be patient if you do not recieve a response right away; keep in mind that our comunity is spread out over the globe in different timezones.
