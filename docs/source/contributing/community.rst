Community communication channels
================================

We use `Gitter <https://gitter.im>`_ for online, real-time text chat. The
primary channel for JupyterHub is `jupyterhub/jupyterhub <https://gitter.im/jupyterhub/jupyterhub>`_.
Remember that our community is distributed across the world in various
timezones, so be patient if you do not get an answer immediately!

GitHub issues are used for most long-form project discussions, bug reports
and feature requests. Issues related to a specific authenticator or
spawner should be directed to the appropriate repository for the
authenticator or spawner. If you are using a specific JupyterHub
distribution (such as `Zero to JupyterHub on Kubernetes <http://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s>`_
or `The Littlest JupyterHub <http://github.com/jupyterhub/the-littlest-jupyterhub/>`_),
you should open issues directly in their repository. If you can not
find a repository to open your issue in, do not worry! Create it in the `main
JupyterHub repository <https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/>`_ and our
community will help you figure it out.

A `mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jupyter>`_ for all
of Project Jupyter exists, along with one for `teaching with Jupyter
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jupyter-education>`_.
