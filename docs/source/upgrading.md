# Upgrading JupyterHub and its database

From time to time, you may wish to upgrade JupyterHub to take advantage
of new releases. Much of this process is automated using scripts,
such as those generated by alembic for database upgrades. Before upgrading a
JupyterHub deployment, it's critical to backup your data and configurations
before shutting down the JupyterHub process and server.

## The upgrade process

Four fundamental process steps are needed when upgrading JupyterHub and its
database:

1. Backup your Hub's data and configurations
2. Shutdown the Hub
3. Upgrade JupyterHub
4. Upgrade the database using run `jupyterhub upgrade-db`

Let's take a closer look at each step in the upgrade process.
